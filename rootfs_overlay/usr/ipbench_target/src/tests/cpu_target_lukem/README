CPU Target Test
===============

This test measures the CPU usage on a target machine.  The underlying
mechanism for determining CPU usage was designed by Luke Mcpherson

YOU NEED TO CALIBRATE THIS TEST

You should have an application built in this directory called
"calibrate".  Run this on a quiet system, and pipe the output to
histogram.sh, also included; e.g.

ianw@lime:~/cpu_target_lukem$ ./calibrate | ./histogram.sh
46.0    999696  100.0%  *******************************************************
47.0    197       0.0%  *
56.0    1         0.0%  *
1387.0  1         0.0%  *
1409.0  1         0.0%  *
1696.0  1         0.0%  *
1707.0  1         0.0%  *
1729.0  1         0.0%  *
1734.0  1         0.0%  *
1737.0  1         0.0%  *
... and so on ...

Look for the number with the most samples beside it and the largest
gap from the small inital numbers (in this case 46 and the gap is
between 56-1387).  You should then set PROFILE_CONTEXT_COST in
cpu_target_lukem.h to be greater than the smallest number but less
than anything around that gap.  I choose around 300 for a 900Mhz
Itanium 2.  This should generally be a good value; but you should
confirm this to get reliable results.
